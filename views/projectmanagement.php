	<p>At All Structure Group LTD. we also create a family orientated atmosphere. As you know, this industry demands often lengthy periods away from home. We do everything we can, to not only acknowledge this fact, but to create an environment where our team truly consider the jobsite a second home. We operate in this manner to ensure our employees are treated as though they are not just another body on the jobsite. This in turn helps employee’s work safely, productively, and with the utmost attention to detail.</p>
