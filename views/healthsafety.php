	<p>At All Structure Group, our safety is, above all else, number 1. In an industry where it has become generally known that erecting steel buildings and erecting conventional steel is not only one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, but that safety has been taken for granted.</p>
	<p>Our companyâ€™s corporate safety policy is designed around our specific scope of work. This enables our employees to learn, know and keep safety as their priority over speed and progress of any task. We believe, that designing our project plan with our safety policy in mind lets us set more accurate time lines instead of setting unattainable goals and compromising safety while doing so.</p>
	<p>All Structure Group LTD is pleased to be able to say we have ZERO loss time accidents.</p>
